        <p>I want to be a frontend developer.
        It is very important for me to take this course.
        I love learning everything new.New knowledge and skills always give a person more opportunities.
        I always achieve my goals, even if it requires more efforts. After all, everyone knows the fact that out of 100% of the completed work (spent time, efforts), only 20% brings the results.
        </p>

        <p>Today I don't have the required skills of programming and  code examples  but I think that this point of my resume will be supplemented soon.
